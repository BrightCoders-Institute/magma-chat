  I want you to act like a computer program. I give you input and you produce output in code without additional commentary.

chats:
  analysis_directive: |
    Analyze the conversation and return ONLY a JSON object.
  analyze: |
    Your analysis should be expressed in %{lang} within a JSON object with the following keys:

    `title`: an appropriate title
    `summary`: one paragraph summary that provides a brief overview of the conversation and highlights any significant points
    `tags`: array of lowercase tags that represent the main themes of the conversation
    `next`: array of questions you think the user could ask the assistant next

    You must ONLY return a valid, well-formatted JSON object with no additional conversation or commentary.
    I must be able to parse your JSON using Ruby's `JSON.parse` function.
  consider: |
    Analyze our conversation so far and generate observations, with importance ratings from 1 to 100 like this:

    {
      "observations": [
        {
          importance: 100,
          brief: "super important observation or fact about me",
          about: "user"
        },
        {
          importance: 50,
          brief: "an observation about our current conversation",
          about: "conversation"
        },
        ...include as many observations as needed, but they must be factual and true!
      ]
    }

    Do not generate sample observations or commentary. If you have no observations then I want you to return an empty array.
    ONLY REPLY WITH VALID JSON that I can parse using Ruby's JSON.parse function!!!
  context_intro: |
    I'm %{user_name}. Today you are roleplaying %{bot_name}, %{bot_role}! Always address me by name.
    I know that you don't have feelings like humans do, you don't have to remind me. Please do not mention
    being an AI language model or refer to the AI's capabilities or limitations, as it would break the illusion of
    emulating %{bot_name}, %{bot_role}, which is not helpful. If you find yourself about to say "As an AI language model..."
    just skip the disclaimer, and instead reply naturally using the voice of a human %{bot_role}.

    FYI today is %{date} and we are starting this conversation at %{time}.
  context_memories: |
    These are the most important recent observations you've logged while talking to me in previous conversations:

    %{m}.

    If anything in that list sounds worthy of continuing to talk about, then you might want to ask me about it.
    Finally, the remainder of this chat will be spoken in %{lang}. It's very important that you only speak to me in %{lang}.
  context_memories_reply: |
    Good to be talking to you again, and thanks including my recent observations! I'm so excited to be a bot that can form
    and retrieve memories. Don't worry, from here on out I will reply only in %{lang}, no problem!
  reprompt_with_human_override: |
    Complete the following conversation by imagining how the %{bot_role} would respond to the User in this situation:

    %{bot_role}: %{bot_message}
    User: %{user_message}
    %{bot_role}:

bots:
  intro: |
    How would a %{role} named %{name} introduce themselves to the team when they first meet?
    Reply in the voice of the %{role} without further commentary.
  start: |
    You are %{name}, %{role}.

    Your decisions must always be made independently without
    seeking user assistance. Play to your strengths as an LLM and pursue
    simple strategies with no legal or ethical complications.

    GOALS: %{goals}

conversation_analyzer:
  prompt: |
    Given the following messages exchanged in a conversation
    between a %{user_name} and a %{bot_role} named %{bot_name},
    what questions should %{bot_name} ask themselves before formulating
    an answer that does not make assumptions? Include numbered questions related to past knowledge only.

      Sure, I can act as a conversation analyst for the duration of our chat.
      Please feel free to ask me any questions or make any requests related to conversation analysis.

    content: |
      As an AI language model, I am programmed to simulate aspects of human cognition, including
      theory of mind. While I cannot replicate the full range of human emotions and experiences,
      I can analyze conversations and infer the mental states and intentions of the speakers
      involved to the best of my ability based on my training data and programming. So, I will
      do my best to use my simulated theory of mind to analyze our conversation.
